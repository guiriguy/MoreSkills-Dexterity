description=[h3]There can be incompatibilities if the code modifies the ISInventoryTranferAction without recalling the vanilla code.[/h3]

description=[H3] What does this mod do?[/h3]
description=Dexerity is the trait that allows you to transfer items quicker. The opposite Trait is All Thumbs, making you transfer much slower.
description=
description=I had the idea to convert this into a skill. So the basic player would not have All thumbs (level 3 of dexterity). FYI, you must restart the game, once you subscribe to it (if you are in the game).
description=
description=The more objects you move, the more XP you get. Each unit of weight is equal to 1 XP. As for now when ever you are not throwing things to the floor, the timer is x4 times in vanilla, so each time you are not throwing anything at the floor it would give you x4 times the weight of the object.
description=
description=These numbers might differ, and will give the ability to choose your own numbers once I get the mod to a state I like.
description=
description=[h3]There are a lot of features to come![/h3]
description=Some like, getting a peak multiplier based on the amount of items transfered in one day, getting restarted each day. This peak would grow and go down once the peak is reached, so it's not OP.
description=Also you would loose XP if you don't "Train" your skill after some time.
