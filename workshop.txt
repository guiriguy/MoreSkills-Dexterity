description=[H3] What does this mod do?[/h3]
description=Dexerity is the trait that allows you to transfer items quicker. The opposite Trait is All Thumbs, making you transfer much slower.

description=I had the idea to convert this into a skill. So the basic player would not have All thumbs (level 3 of dexterity).

description=Since v0.1.2:
description= - The amount of XP when throwing things to the floor will be 0.25xp per kilo. If you are moving from/to other containers you will gain 1xp per kilo.
description= - As a antiexploid method, now the xp will gain a multiplier based on the amout of weight moved that day. At level 5 you will gain max of 7,5 as a multiplier, once you have moved 1000 kilos. Once this peak is reached, the multiplier will go gradually down until you have moved 2000 kilos. After that it will be base XP (1xp per kilo moved).-
description= - Now when you die, you will get the intended, base 3 levels of Dexterity, unless you choose as Trait All Thumbs or Dextrous.

description=P.S: These numbers might differ, and will give the ability to choose your own numbers once I get the mod to a state I like.[/quote]
