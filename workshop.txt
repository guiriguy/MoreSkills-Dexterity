description=[H3] What does this mod do?[/h3]
description=Dexerity is the trait that allows you to transfer items quicker. The opposite Trait is All Thumbs, making you transfer much slower.
description=
description=I had the idea to convert this into a skill. So the basic player would not have All thumbs (level 3 of dexterity).

description=Since v0.1.2:
description= - The amount of XP when throwing things on the floor will be 0.25xp per kilo. If you are moving from/to other containers you will gain 1xp per kilo.
description= - As an antiexploit method, now the xp will gain a multiplier based on the amout of weight moved that day. At level 5 you will gain max of 7,5 as a multiplier, once you have moved 1000 kilos. Once this peak is reached, the multiplier will go gradually down until you have moved 2000 kilos. After that it will be base XP (1xp per kilo moved).-
description= - Now when you die, you will get the intended base 3 levels of Dexterity, unless you choose All Thumbs or Dextrous  as Trait.
description=
description=P.S: These numbers might differ, and will give the ability to choose your own numbers once I get the mod to a state I like.[/quote]

description=[h3]There are a lot of features to come![/h3]

description=Also you would lose XP if you don't "Train" your skill after some time.
description=You will no longer lose your gained XP and levels if the mod is deactivated by mistake (Coming in next update)
